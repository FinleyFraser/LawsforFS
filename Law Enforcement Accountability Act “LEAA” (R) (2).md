**§9. Sentencing Considerations**

(a) Upon liability of any of the above the judicial official shall consider the recommendations of both sides, whether or not there was malicious intent, the tortfeasor’s/offender’s offense history, the knowledge of the law violated, and the injury done to the plaintiff/victims.

(b) Upon conviction of any of the above, and the judicial official determines that the issuance of any of the punishments under this bill is to be done, the judicial official will issue said punishment through a proper court order directing the affected agency to carry out said action.

(c) A judicial official shall be responsible for sentencing the tortfeasor/convicted to a fair, reasonable and deserved sentence pursuant to §9(a).

(d) No tortfeasor shall have their POST Certification revoked nor be terminated from the department the tortfeasor was representing at the time the tort was committed if all of the following is true:
>  **(i)** This is the first time they've been found liable of a tort as defined in §7 within 365 days of the filing date of the civil complaint;
> 
>  **(ii)** There was no malicious intent;
>
> **(iii)** There was no gross negligence; and
> 
>  **(iv)** The tort committed was not subject to §8(d) of this act (this shall not be construed to revoke/terminate over more “petty” violations)

(e) If a tortfeasor is sentenced to mandatory (re) training with the Department of Justice and/or Peace Officer Standards and Training, with a suspension of the tortfeasor's POST Certification until the completion of such (re) training, then such (re) training shall be on relevant laws surrounding the tort committed. No (re) training shall be excessive to the point where the tortfeasor is unable to complete said (re) training within a reasonable time frame. The Attorney General or Director for the Department of Justice or Peace Officer Standards and Training, respectively, shall delegate an individual(s) to fulfill said (re) training with their agency if affected by a proper court order.

(f) No suspension, whether it be from duties or their POST certification, shall last longer than 30 days for a single unlawful encounter barring the punishments set forth by §8(f) of this act. (i.e. an officer is convicted of §8(a) and §8(c) for a singular encounter, while the maximum suspension adds up to 44 days; they may not be suspended for longer than 30 days.)

(g) It is not the legislature’s intent that any judicial official sentences a tortfeasor or convicted to the maximum sentence permitted, and it is suggested that judicial officials sentence leniently until it becomes necessary for more harsh sentences (especially in regards to unlawful acts of non-malice and non gross-negligence whereas the effect on the victim was minimal).
