**INTRODUCTION & EVIDENCE**

[1] On March 5th, 2025, at or around 10:39 Eastern Time, kam1rny (the petitioner) filed an arrest warrant request against British Columbia Resident MikeOutlaws (the accused).

[2] Kam1rny, at the time of the incident, was on team and representing the British Columbia Sheriffs Services, making him a law enforcement officer (required by 306(B)).

[3] The affidavit attached to the warrant request can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_F0-i41Vedqr6n_s8jr7EXhhlXd4m7vY/view) (Affidavit A),

[4] The petitioner included an additional witness, dontreforli, a British Columbia Resident who made the affidavit found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JFeyk4R7atrK8rWabEDl9uwrrozcgL57/view) (Affidavit B).

[5] Attached to the warrant was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqPY31mzNys) (Exhibit A) video.

[6] In the case channel [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkwlKt8i8rY) (Exhibit B) video and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irsw-y2JNFY) (Exhibit C) video were added as evidence. 

[7] The petitioner is asking the court to issue an arrest warrant against MikeOutlaws for the following crimes: [dangerous operations](https://trello.com/c/2Ht3LwOB/117-dangerous-operation), [public mischief](https://trello.com/c/iHJIBTyR/34-public-mischief), [criminal harassment](https://trello.com/c/1ttEtgKe/58-criminal-harassment), [failure to stop after accident](https://trello.com/c/CE0LhETC/115-failure-to-stop-after-accident), [mischief](https://trello.com/c/ZyeVy9ZQ/125-mischief).

**PROOF OF IDENTIFICATION**

[8] Before determining whether the crimes alleged were committed or not to the Probable Cause standard this court must first determine there is evidence to the Probable Cause standard that MikeOutlaws is the person exhibited in the presented Exhibits (also known as "Proof of Identification" or "POID").

[9] Exhibit A is recorded from the Point of View (POV) of a "MADSEC" Security employee. It shows a pinkish-purpleish Ferrari (or similar) following the employee (the entire clip basically) and ramming it multiple times (Timestamps: 1:12, 1:20, 2:26, 2:48, 3:37). It also shows the Ferrari "drifting" and driving recklessly throughout the entire clip.

[10] It is alleged that the driver of this vehicle is the accused, MikeOutlaws. Exhibit A does not provide any proof of identification that connects MikeOutlaws to these crimes, however, further exhibits do.

[11] Exhibit B (only becoming relevant from 1:30 and onward). We see the end of Exhibit A (5:07ish and onwards) and the start of Exhibit B (1:38ish-2:29ish) overlap, proving that Exhibit A was recorded on March 5th at roughly 03:49 (whatever timezone the in game clock uses).

[12] Due to this overlap, there is absolutely no doubt the two videos are connected and contiguous from each other showing the further development of the scene(s) and incident(s) in Exhibit A.

[13] At 2:39 Deputy Kam1rny informs the accused that he is detained "You're detained" (although he is unable to state a reason before the accused leaves). The accused then leaves at 2:50 and the game displays a "Player Left" message with the username "MikeOutlaws".

[14] Using the player left message, we can now connect the driver of the pinkish-purpleish Ferrari to MikeOutlaws, confirming that, at least to the probable cause standard, MikeOutlaws is the driver of the Ferrari. 

[15] Now that POID has been established to a Probable Cause standard this court must determine if the accused has committed the alleged crimes to a Probable Cause standard.

**DANGEROUS OPERATION**

[16] Dangerous Operation is defined as "operat[ing] a conveyance in a manner that, having regard to all of the circumstances, is dangerous to the public [...]".

[17] MikeOutlaws drifting the Ferrari he was driving, using it to ram into the "MADSEC" Security car several times, driving off the road (on the sidewalk/over curbs), and overall driving in a reckless manner created a danger to the public.

[18] As such, this court is convinced to the Probable Cause standard that MikeOutlaws operated a conveyance (another person's Ferrari he stole but that's irrelevant) in a dangerous manner to the public.

[19] No circumstances would justify this degree of dangerous and reckless operation of a vehicle except if MikeOutlaws life was in immediate risk and he was fleeing from this risk.

[20] However, this court is fairly certain using context clues from Exhibit B that MikeOutlaws was not fleeing for his life, but was instead trying to get the "MADSEC" Security drivers "insurance" for a hit and run, no where near justifying his actions (He could have, and should have reported it to the police instead of chasing the "MADSEC" Security officer).

**PUBLIC MISCHIEF** 

[21] Public Mischief is (summarily) defined as causing a peace officer to start or continue an investigation by reporting a crime that did not happen.

[22] Exhibit A starts with MikeOutlaws and the "MADSEC" Security Officer already interacting, and due to there being no audio it is impossible to know what they were talking about

[23] Due to the above, it is impossible to determine what occurred before the video and if either subject had "hit" the other subject.

[24] Therefore, this court cannot, at least to the Probable Cause standard, say that MikeOutlaws falsely accused the "MADSEC" Security Officer of a crime, tried to play the "victim" or falsely tried to divert the suspicion from himself.

**CRIMINAL HARASSMENT** 

[25] Criminal Harassment is (summarily) defined as making someone fear for their safety by following them (doing some other stuff that is not relevant here) and engaging in threatening conduct with them.

[26] Exhibit A shows MikeOutlaws following the "MADSEC" Security Officer for almost 3 minutes from place to place, getting out several times to utilize the Roblox voice chat feature (probably to engage in threatening conduct but this cannot be proven).

[27] However, threatening conduct can be proven at roughly 0:07 of Exhibit A when MikeOutlaws jumps on the hood of the "MADSEC" Security car and begins "punching".

[28] There is no real way to get legal authority for the actions done in Exhibit A, and as such, these actions do not meet the legal authority exemption.

[29] As such, this court can, to the Probable Cause standard, say that MikeOutlaws did not have the legal authority to follow the "MADSEC" Security Officer, and that MikeOutlaws reasonably (and in the whole of circumstances), made the "MADSEC" Security Officer fear for his safety by following him and engaging in threatening behaviour.

**FAILURE TO STOP AFTER ACCIDENT**

[30] Failure to Stop After Accident is (summarily) defined as operating a conveyance and knowing that you hit another vehicle or person and failing to stop the conveyance and give their name (without **reasonable** excuse).

[31] MikeOutlaws got into at least 5 crashes with the "MADSEC" Security Officer. Every time, both drove off without providing their names. (Neither even attempted)

[32] It is clear both drivers are guilty of this offense (if there was not exceptions), ***__HOWEVER__***, there is an exception! If the person has a "reasonable excuse" they are exempt from this law!

[33] This court believes that the "MADSEC" Security Officer has a reasonable excuse to leave the scene of the accident, he was being rammed and chased by a person in a Ferrari.

[34] This court does NOT believe that MikeOutlaws had a reasonable excuse to leave the scene of the accident SOLELY because he caused every single one by hitting the "MADSEC" Security Officer chasing him down.

[35] HOWEVER, it is unreasonable and outrageous to expect MikeOutlaws to give his name to the "MADSEC" Security Officer if the "MADSEC" Security Officer left the scene of the crime.

[36] BUT, MikeOutlaws had the opportunity to give the "MADSEC" Security Officer his name when they both stopped at Denman Street @ the West Georgia intersection and were talking. However, instead of giving his name MikeOutlaws left the game.

[37] As such, because MikeOutlaws caused every collision and then left the game when given a reasonable opportunity to provide his name to the "MADSEC" Security Officer this court has Probable Cause to say he did in fact commit "Failure to Stop After Accident"

**MISCHIEF** 

[38] Mischief is defined as any person who does any of the following acts: "destroys or damages property; renders property dangerous, useless, inoperative or ineffective; obstructs, interrupts or interferes with the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of property; or obstructs, interrupts or interferes with any person in the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of property."

[39] By continuously ramming the "MADSEC" Security Officer (and flipping his car at points) he rendered the property (the "MADSEC" Security car) inoperable as it was not on its wheels.

[40] Furthermore, MikeOutlaws obstructed, interrupted, and interfered with the lawful operation, enjoyment, and use of the "MADSEC" Security car by cutting it off and hitting it.

[41] As such, this court has Probable Cause to believe that MikeOutlaws did Mischief by interfering with the "MADSEC" Security Officer/their car and rendering it inoperable.

**306(E) SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES**

[42] The General Rules of Procedure, specifically Rule 306(E) states "Warrants cannot be issued for crimes committed over 14 days old except in special circumstances." 

[43] It is clear that this incident happened more than 14 days ago and thus the warrant cannot be issued, unless special circumstances can be determined by this court.

[44] Special circumstances refer to situations where something out of the ordinary has occurred that requires special attention or consideration. (Quoted from [LSD.law](https://www.lsd.law/define/special-circumstances))

[45] This court must determine whether a situation out of the ordinary occurred, and if one did, if it justifies issuing the warrant and ignoring Rule 306(E). This is the first time special circumstances have been determined for this rule, meaning there is no active precedent, and this case will be the precedent maker. 

[46] In the consideration of "special circumstances" in this case, this court is also going to keep in mind the intent of this clause, which this court luckily knows as they authored the majority of the Rules of Procedures, including this Rule.

[47] The intent of Rule 306(E) was to stop cops from waiting forever to file for warrants on crimes that happened forever ago. The exception was made with CSIS and other intelligence and investigatory agencies and divisions in mind, noting they may need extra time to gather evidence as a part of operations.

[48] While writing this Rule the author did not consider if a warrant request itself takes over 14 days, however, with it being kept in mind that the petitioner filed the same day as the offense this court finds it reasonable to believe that not issuing the warrant due to 306(E) would be against the intent of the rules. 

[49] Furthermore, this court believes a special circumstance did occur in this case. A vital witness was required to give their testimony via affidavit but was difficult to reach and have do their affidavit.

[50] It took 21 days for the court to get the witness to make their affidavit due to technology issues, real-life commitments, and issues originally reaching them. 

[51] Keeping this in mind, the court believes it was in the best interest of justice to get the affidavit as the testimony was vital to the situations that occurred and that it would be wrong and unfair to deny the warrant because the witness did not do the affidavit quick enough.

[52] As such, this court believes there are special circumstances that occurred here and will be issuing the warrant notwithstanding Rule 306(E).

**NO AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE**

[53] There is no applicable affirmative defense this court could find or immediately think of in the writing and issuance of this arrest warrant (especially given the fact the Ferrari was *likely* stolen by MikeOutlaws (irrelevant again)).

**FINDINGS**

[54] AS SUCH, this court finds that there is probable cause for the Arrest Warrant for MikeOutlaws on the following crimes: Dangerous Operation, Criminal Harassment, Failure to Stop After Accident, and Mischief.

[55] This court finds there is NO probable cause for the Arrest Warrant for MikeOutlaws on the following crime: Public Mischief.

**JUDGEMENT & ORDER**

[56] Therefore, the Arrest Warrant for MikeOutlaws is granted and issued (which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10lFQxmnYDZxF_FP1UISjcBXbwcW3XnUX/view?usp=sharing))

[57] As such, every peace officer within the Province of British Columbia who is duly certified and authorized to practice as a peace officer is **ORDERED** to arrest MikeOutlaws for the crimes outlined on the arrest warrant.

[58] Failure to execute the arrest warrant when given the opportunity **WILL** result in a Contempt of Court charge.

In the Matter of an Applicant for an Arrest Warrant, the application is partially granted.
